# NEAT racer
 Trained basic driving AI with Neural Evolution of Augmented Topologies in a self-built simple 2D racing game using PyGame. The project involved developing a basic racing game with physics engine, setting up a neural network to control a vehicle and training it to complete a course.
 
 This is still a working progress as the hyperparameters are not optimal and more training is needed, but you can run the multi_racer file to watch one of the saved networks run.
